# ðŸš€ AI Agents for Resume Optimization

This repository demonstrates how **AI agents** can assist in **resume tailoring and interview preparation** by analyzing job postings, extracting relevant skills, and optimizing application materials. The **multi-agent system** leverages **Amazon Bedrock**, and **CrewAI** to automate resume enhancement and interview readiness.

## ðŸŒŸ How It Works

The system takes in inputs like **resumes, GitHub profiles, and personal websites**, processes them using AI agents, and produces tailored resumes and interview Q&A to maximize job application success.

### **ðŸ”¹ Agents & Responsibilities**
1. **Job Researcher** â€“ Extracts key skills and qualifications from job postings.
2. **Personal Profiler** â€“ Analyzes the candidateâ€™s strengths from various online sources.
3. **Resume Strategist** â€“ Customizes resumes based on the extracted insights.
4. **Interview Coach** â€“ Generates key Q&A for interview preparation.

Each agent works in collaboration under a **Crew Manager LLM**, ensuring a structured workflow.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following set up:


### ðŸ›  Environment Setup

- Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install crewai crewai_tools anthropic litellm langchain_community
  ```

- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

- Use either:
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook and open the provided `.ipynb` file.
  - **VS Code (Jupyter Extension)**: Open the `.ipynb` file in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **Jupyter** extension for an integrated coding experience.  
  - **Google Colab**: Upload the `.ipynb` file to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an easy-to-use cloud environment.
  - **Amazon SageMaker**: Use [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) for a managed and scalable machine learning environment.

### ðŸ”‘ API Keys

1. **Serper API Key** (or other search APIs):
   - Sign up at [Serper](https://serper.dev/) to obtain an API key.
   - Rename `sample.env` to `.env`
   - Add the key to the `.env` file as `SERPER_API_KEY`.

### ðŸ”§ AWS Configuration

To use models on **Amazon Bedrock**, follow these steps:

### 1. Sign Up for an AWS Account (if you donâ€™t have one)
- Create a free-tier AWS account at [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
- Ensure your account is fully activated before proceeding.

### 2. Install AWS CLI
- Download and install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) from the [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- Verify the installation by running:
  ```bash
  aws --version

### 3. Configure AWS Credentials

Run the following command to set up your AWS credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- **AWS Access Key ID**
- **AWS Secret Access Key**
- **Default AWS Region** (e.g., `us-west-2`)
- **Output format** (default is `json`)

When selecting a region, choose one where Amazon Bedrock models are available. You can check model availability across different AWS regions in the official documentation [Supported Models and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html).
If models are available in multiple regions, select the one closest to you to minimize latency.

### 4. Request Access to Amazon Bedrock Models

Amazon Bedrock requires explicit access to specific foundation models.

- Navigate to the [Amazon Bedrock Console](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and request access to the models you want to use.  
- Some models may have limited availability based on your AWS region.  

Once access is granted, you can start using Amazon Bedrock models in your applications. ðŸš€
