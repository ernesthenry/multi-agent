## ðŸš€ Getting Started


# Python Environment Configuration with Caching

This repository provides a Python module `utils.py` for managing environment variables with caching, validation, and default configurations. It's designed to simplify handling environment-specific settings in your Python applications.

### Installation

No installation is needed since this is just a single Python file.  Simply place the `utils.py` (replace with the actual name of your script) in your project directory.


### Environment Variable Files

Rename `samples.env` to `.env` and update the API keys in those files.

You can customize the paths to these files using the `dotenv_paths` parameter in the `load_env` method:

```python
from utils import Environment  # Replace utils

Environment.load_env(dotenv_paths=['config/.env', '.env.defaults'])
```
